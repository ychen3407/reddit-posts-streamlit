This project is a streamlit project that build a simple app to visualize reddit post trend and understand post sentiment.

In this repo, I included a sample .json file that I scraped recently from Reddit Tiktok subreddit. Scraping details can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/ychen3407/Reddit-Posts-Analysis.git)

Next Step:
1. Scrape more data in the past year to visualize the trend and understand influence of recent TikTok Ban.
2. Streamline data to achieve real-time processing if possible
3. Find better ways to cluster keywords

### How to run it on your own machine

1. Install the requirements

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the app

   ```
   $ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```
